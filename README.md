# Distance Data
as of this commit there are only pkls for some of the FADs
see some of the scripts for examples on how this data was generated.

This is just raw data for now (hence .pkl)

Coming Soon to a Repo near you:
 - Visualizations on this data
 - An unsupervised clustering model/approach
 - A web app to play with all of this
